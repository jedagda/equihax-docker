Dunno if the names of the directories have to remain the same but i left them 
exactly as they were in the test server for consistency reasons.

The index page is the main page of the equifax website and the 
dispute page is exactly what it sounds like. Within the 2 folders are
CSS and Javascript dependencies that came when using httrack as well as a
deep directory where the files were originally located. Once again for
consistency reasons I didn't modify anything within it and would probably
suggest the same to avoid short sighted headachers UwU
